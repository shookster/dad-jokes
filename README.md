# Dad Jokes! 


## Description 
Do you ever feel that there aren't enough dad jokes in the world? Do you want to do your part to get more out there for people to see? Then the Dad Jokes! site is perfect for you. Add, rate and view other people's jokes with our intuitive bar of jokes (see left side of screen).

## Live Site
[Dad Jokes! The Site](https://vast-gorge-32848.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage
When you open the site you'll be greeted by an entry page where it prompts you to either log in or sign up for an account. If you don't have an account then you can sign up through our form by providing an email and selecting a password. After that you are redirected to the login page where you can access the site and test your memory of what you've already entered before. Finally you end up on the home page of the app, where it will display current jokes on our server, including the setup, genre and rating. When you click on the joke it'll show up in the jumbotron for all to see but it saves the punchline for you to click. Once clicked you unleash the comedy gold that is the saved punchline where afterwards you can submit your rating and change how everyone looks at the jokes you've seen. If you think you can do better you can add a joke by using the add a joke button beneath the review bar. By choosing this you're redirected to a form where you can set up your own joke, laugh at your own punchline and figure out what genre your joke is and submit it to our joke bar (see left side of screen on home page). From there you're safely redirected back to the homepage where you can see your new joke in all it's glory and wait for someone to review it.

## Challenges
Getting  authentication working, specifically how we would implement it into our application. Additionally another challenge was setting the rating system to correspond with the joke that we were viewing, which was down to the wire to sort out on our end.
